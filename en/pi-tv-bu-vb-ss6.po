A <i lang="pi">vidatthi</i> is often translated as a hand-span. <i lang="pi">Sugata</i> is an epithet of the Buddha, but in this context it quite possibly should be understood as referring to a standard, “the standard hand-span.” The commentary, <span class="ref">Sp.3.567.21</span>, says that, “Here the <i lang="pi">sugata vidatthi</i> is equal to three <i lang="pi">vidatthis</i> of an average man,” <i lang="pi">sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo</i>.
