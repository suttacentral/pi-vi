<h1>Monks’ Confession 9: the training rule on informing about what is serious</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.31"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.9.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.219"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa295"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was quarreling with the monks from the group of six.</p>
<p>At this time Upananda committed an offense of intentional emission of semen. He then asked the Order for probation for that offense, which he received. Just then an association in Sāvatthī was offering a meal to the Order. Because Upananda was on probation, he was seated on the last seat in the dining hall. The monks from the group of six then told those lay followers, “Sirs, this Venerable Upananda, the esteemed associate of your families, eats the food given in faith with the same hand he uses to emit semen. After committing an offense of intentional emission of semen, he asked the Order for probation for that offense, which he received. And because he’s on probation, he’s seated on the last seat in the dining hall.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa296"></a> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six inform a person who’s not fully ordained about a monk’s serious offense?” … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.220"></a> The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you inform a person who’s not fully ordained about a monk’s serious offense? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa297"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk informs a person who is not fully ordained about another monk’s serious offense, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
