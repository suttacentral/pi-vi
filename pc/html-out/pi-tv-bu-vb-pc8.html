<h1>Monks’ Confession 8: the training rule on informing truthfully</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.24"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.8.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.8.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.208"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa220"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Just then a number of monks who were friends had entered the rains on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. Just then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw, and it was not easy to get by on almsfood.</p>
<p>The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains, and get almsfood without problems?”</p>
<p>Some said, “We could do work for the householders, and they’ll give something in return. In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p>Some said, “There’s no need to do work for the householders. Let’s instead take messages for them, and they’ll give something in return. In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood.”</p>
<p>Some said, “There’s no need to do work for the householders, nor to take messages for them.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.209"></a> Let’s instead praise one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders, ‘Such a monk has the first absorption, such a monk the second absorption, such a monk the third, such a monk the fourth; such a monk is a stream-enterer, such a monk a once-returner, such a non-returner, such a perfected one; such a monk has the three true insights, and such the six direct knowledges.’ Then they’ll give to us. In this way we’ll be united and in harmony, and we’ll spend the rains in comfort and have no problems getting almsfood. Indeed, this is the better way, that we praise one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa221"></a> Then they praised each other’s superhuman qualities to the householders, “Such a monk has the first absorption … such a monk has the six direct knowledges.” And those people thought, “We’re fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rains. Such monks as these, who are virtuous and of good character, have never before entered the rains with us.” And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives.<span class="var" hidden>sāyanti pivanti → attanā pivanti (bj, s1-3, pts1, mr)</span> In this way those monks became handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear skin.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.25"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.8.1.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa222"></a> Now it was the custom for monks who had finished keeping the rains to go and see the Master.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.210"></a> So when the rainy-season residence was completed and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and departed for Vesālī. When they eventually arrived at Vesālī, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Master, bowed down to him, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p>At that time the monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in that region were thin, haggard and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs. But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were handsome, with rounded features, bright faces, and clear skin.</p>
<p>It is the custom for Buddhas to greet visiting monks, and so the Master said to them, “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable; I hope you spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>“We’re keeping well, Master, we’re comfortable; we spent the rains at ease, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.”</p>
<p>Buddhas sometimes ask knowing, and knowing sometimes do not ask; they ask knowing the right time to ask, and they ask knowing the right time not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial; in regard to what is unbeneficial, the Buddhas have destroyed the bridge. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa223"></a> And the Master said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you spend the rains at ease, without having any trouble getting almsfood?”</p>
<p>And they informed the Master of what had happened.</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.211"></a> “But had you really achieved those superhuman qualities?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “Monks, how can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s superhuman qualities to householders? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
