<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.1"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa2"></a> Venerables, these ninety-two rules entailing confession come up for recitation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> Homage to the Master, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One</p>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.1.1"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa3"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. Just then Hatthaka the Sakyan had been beaten in debate.<span class="note" hidden>According to <span class="ref">Sp.4.736.6</span> this means: “Before the meal, etc., he would make an appointment, saying, ‘Let there be a debate at such-and-such a time and at such-and-such a place,’ and he would then go there before or after the time of the appointment, saying, ‘Look, sirs, the ascetics of other sects have not come; they are defeated,’ and he would then depart,” <i lang="pi">purebhattādīsu, “asukasmiṃ nāma kāle asukasmiṃ nāma padese vādo hotū”ti saṅketaṃ katvā saṅketato pure vā pacchā vā gantvā, “passatha bho, titthiyā na āgatā parājitā”ti pakkamati</i>.</span> While talking with ascetics of other sects, he would assert things after denying them, and he would deny things after asserting them. He evaded the issues, lied, and made sham appointments.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.165"></a> The ascetics of other sects complained and criticized him, “When Hatthaka talks with us, how can he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa4"></a> The monks heard the complaints of those ascetics of other sects, and they went to Hatthaka and said, “Is it true, Hatthaka, that you are acting in this way?”</p>
<p>“These ascetics of other sects should be beaten, whatever it takes. They should not be allowed to win.”</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized him, “When Hatthaka talks with ascetics of other sects, how can he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa5"></a> After criticizing Hatthaka in many ways, they informed the Master. The Master then had the Order of monks assembled and questioned Hatthaka, “Is it true, Hatthaka, that you are acting in this way?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, when you talk with ascetics of other sects, how can you assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
