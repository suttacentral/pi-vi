<h1>Monks’ Confession 6: the second training rule on the same sleeping place</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.18"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.6.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.198"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa182"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.<span class="var" hidden>janapade → janapadesu (bj, s1-3, pts1)</span> Just then, while Venerable Anuruddha was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī, one evening he arrived at a certain village. Just then a woman in that village had prepared her rest house. Anuruddha approached that woman and said, “If it’s not inconvenient for you, I’d like to stay in your rest house for one night.”</p>
<p>“Please stay, Venerable.”</p>
<p>Other travelers also approached that woman and said, “Madam, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay in your rest house for one night.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, an ascetic is already staying there. If he agrees, you may stay.”</p>
<p>Those travelers then approached Anuruddha and said, “Venerable, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay one night in the rest house.”</p>
<p>“Please stay.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.19"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa183"></a> Now as soon as that woman had seen Anuruddha, she had fallen in love with him.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.199"></a> She now approached him and said, “Venerable, you won’t be at ease surrounded by these people. It would be good if I prepared a bed for you in the main house.” Anuruddha consented by remaining silent.</p>
<p>After preparing a bed in the main house, she put on jewelery and perfume, and she approached Anuruddha and said, “Venerable, you’re good-looking and graceful, and so am I. It would be good, Venerable, if I were to become your wife.” But Anuruddha remained silent. She said the same thing a second time, but again got no response. And a third time she said, “Venerable, you’re good-looking and graceful, and so am I.<span class="var" hidden>paṭicchatu → sampaṭicchatu (s1-3)</span> It would be good, Venerable, if you took me and all this property.” But Anuruddha remained silent for a third time. She then threw off her clothes, and she walked up and down, stood, sat down, and lay down in front of him. But Anuruddha controlled his senses and neither looked at nor spoke to her. Then that woman said, “It’s astonishing and amazing. Many people send for me with a hundred or a thousand coins. But this ascetic, even when begged by me, does not want me and all this property.”<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.200"></a> After dressing, she fell down with her head at the feet of Anuruddha and said, “Venerable, I’ve committed an offense, in that foolishly, confused, and unskillfully I acted in this way. Venerable, please forgive me for my offense so that I may restrain myself in the future.”</p>
<p>“Certainly you have committed an offense, in that foolishly, confused, and unskillfully you acted in this way. But since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones, that is, acknowledging an offense, making amends in accordance with the Teaching, and undertaking restraint for the future.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa184"></a> The following morning, with her own hands, that woman served and satisfied Anuruddha with various kinds of fine food. When he had finished his meal, she bowed down to him, and sat down to one side. And Anuruddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. She then said to him, “Wonderful, Venerable, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—even so has Anuruddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. Venerable, I go for refuge to the Master and to the Teaching and to the Order of monks.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.201"></a> Please accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa185"></a> Soon afterwards, after arriving at Sāvatthī, Anuruddha informed the monks of what had happened. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized Anuruddha, “How can Venerable Anuruddha sleep in the same sleeping place as a woman?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa186"></a> After criticizing him in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, Anuruddha, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>Anuruddha, how can you sleep in the same sleeping place as a woman? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
