<h1>Monks’ Confession 5: the training rule on the same sleeping place</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.5.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.194"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa164"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine. At that time the lay followers were going to the monastery to listen to the Teaching. When the instruction was over, the senior monks went to their own dwellings, but the newly ordained monks went to sleep right there in the assembly-hall together with the lay people—mindlessly, thoughtlessly, naked, muttering, and snoring. The lay people complained and criticized them, “How can the Venerables go to sleep mindlessly, thoughtlessly, naked, muttering, and snoring?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.16"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa165"></a> The monks heard the complaints of those lay people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks sleep in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa166"></a> After criticizing those newly ordained monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that monks do this?”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.195"></a> “It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha criticized them, “… How can those foolish men sleep in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa167"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk sleeps in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa168"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.5.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa169"></a> After staying at Āḷavī for as long as he wanted, the Master set out for Kosambī. When he eventually arrived at Kosambī, he stayed at the Badarikā Monastery.</p>
<p>Just then the monks said to Venerable Rāhula, “Rāhula, the Master has laid down a training rule that we cannot sleep in the same sleeping place as a person who’s not fully ordained. Please find another sleeping place.” Since Rāhula was not able to get a sleeping place, he lay down to sleep in the restroom.</p>
<p>Then, after rising early in the morning, the Master went to the restroom, where he coughed. Rāhula coughed too.</p>
<p>“Who’s there?”</p>
<p>“It’s me, Master, Rāhula.”</p>
<p>“Why are you sitting here, Rāhula?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa170"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.196"></a> Rāhula informed the Master of what had happened. Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks,<strong class="rule"> “Monks, I allow you to sleep in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained for two or three nights.</strong> And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><span class="var" hidden>sahaseyyaṃ → saha seyyaṃ (s1-3)</span><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa171"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk sleeps for more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>

If it is someone who is not fully ordained, but the monk perceives him as fully ordained, and he sleeps in the same sleeping place as him for more than two or three nights, he commits an offense entailing confession.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="16"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa179"></a> If it is half-roofed and half-walled, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is someone who is fully ordained, but the monk perceives him as not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is someone who is fully ordained, but the monk is unsure if he is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is someone who is fully ordained, and the monk perceives him as fully ordained, there is no offense.</p>
