<h1>Monks’ Confession 7: the training rule on teaching</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.7.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.203"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa197"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. Then, after dressing one morning, he took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family. Just then the housewife was sitting at the entrance door and the daughter-in-law at the door to one of the rooms. Udāyī went up to the housewife and gave her a teaching, whispering in her ear. And the daughter-in-law thought, “Is this ascetic my mother-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking lewdly?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.21"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa198"></a> After teaching the housewife in this way, Udāyī approached the daughter-in-law and gave her a teaching in the same way. Then the housewife thought, “Is this ascetic my daughter-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking lewdly?”</p>
<p>After giving a teaching in this way, Udāyī left. Then the housewife said to her daughter-in-law, “Hey, what did that ascetic say to you?”</p>
<p>“He gave me a teaching, Madam. But what did he say to you?”</p>
<p>“He gave me a teaching, too.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.204"></a> And they complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Udāyī give teachings by whispering in the ear? Should not teachings be given audibly and openly?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa199"></a> The monks heard the complaints of those women, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized Udāyī, “How can Venerable Udāyī give teachings to women?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa200"></a> After criticizing him in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you give teachings to women? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>First preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa201"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk gives a teaching to a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa202"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.7.2"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.205"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa203"></a> Soon afterwards some female lay followers saw some monks and said to them, “Venerables, please give a teaching.”</p>
<p>“It’s not allowable for us to teach women.”</p>
<p>“Please just teach five or six sentences. Even with that much it’s possible to understand the Teaching.”</p>
<p>“It’s not allowable for us to teach women.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not teach them.</p>
<p>Then those female lay followers complained and criticized them, “How can they not teach us when asked?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa204"></a> The monks heard the complaints of those female lay followers, and they informed the Master. Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks, “Monks, I allow you to teach five or six sentences to a woman. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Second preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="9"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa205"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk gives a teaching of more than five or six sentences to a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="10"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.22"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa206"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Third sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="11"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.7.3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa207"></a> When the monks from the group of six knew that the Master had made this allowance, they taught women more than five or six sentences in the presence of a man who did not understand. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six teach women more than five or six sentences in the presence of a man who does not understand?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="12"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa208"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you teach women more than five or six sentences in the presence of a man who doesn’t understand?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.206"></a> This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
