<h1>Monks’ Confession 10: the training rule on digging the earth</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.10.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.223"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa321"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine.<span class="var" hidden>āḷavakā → āḷavikā (s1-3, pts1)</span> At that time the monks at Āḷavī were doing building work. And they dug the earth and got it dug. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan ascetics dig the earth and get it dug? They are hurting life with one sense faculty.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.33"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa322"></a> The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks at Āḷavī dig the earth and get it dug?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you dig the earth and get it dug? People regard the earth as conscious. This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
