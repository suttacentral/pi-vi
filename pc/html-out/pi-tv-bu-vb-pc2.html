<h1>Monks’ Confession 2: the training rule on abusive speech</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.5"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.2.1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.2.1.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.171"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa29"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.<span class="var" hidden>bhaṇḍantā → bhaṇḍentā (bj, pts1)</span> At that time the monks from the group of six were arguing with and abusing good monks. They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, work, craft, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names. The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six argue with and abuse good monks? How can they revile and insult them about these things?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa30"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you are acting in this way?” “It’s true, Master.” The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you argue with and abuse good monks?<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.172"></a> How can you revile and insult them about their caste, name, family, work, craft, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it …” … and after rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>
<h5>Jataka</h5>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><span class="var" hidden>balībaddo → balivaddo (bj) | balibaddo (s1-3, pts1)</span><span class="var" hidden>takkasilāyaṃ → takkasīlāyaṃ (mr)</span>
<div class="jataka">
<p><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.2.1.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa31"></a> “Once upon a time, monks, there was a brahmin in Takkasilā who had an ox called Nandivisāla. On one occasion the ox said to the brahmin, ‘Go, brahmin, and make the following bet worth one thousand coins with a prominent merchant: “My ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.”’ And that brahmin did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said,<span class="var" hidden>gaccha, kūṭa → añcha kūṭa (bj, s1-3)</span> ‘Go, you fraud; pull, you liar.’ But Nandivisāla just stood right there.</p>
<p>Then that brahmin became depressed because he had lost one thousand coins. And Nandivisāla said to him, ‘Why are you depressed?’</p>
<p>‘Because I lost one thousand coins because of you.’</p>
<p>‘But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not? Now go, brahmin, and make the same bet worth two thousand coins with that merchant. But don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud.’ Once again that brahmin did just that.<a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.173"></a> Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said, ‘Go, good ox; pull, good ox.’ And Nandivisāla pulled those one hundred carts.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa32"></a> One should say what is pleasant,<br>Never what is unpleasant.<br>For him of pleasant speech,<br>Heavy loads got carried,<br>And he obtained wealth;<br>And he was delighted with that.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.6"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa33"></a> Even at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me. How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
