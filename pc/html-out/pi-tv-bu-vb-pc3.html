<h1>Monks’ Confession 3: the training rule on malicious talebearing</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pi" id="pts-vp-pi4.12"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.3.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.186"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa111"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six were engaged in malicious talebearing between monks who were arguing. After hearing something on one side they reported it to the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division between them. In this way new quarrels were created and existing quarrels became worse.</p>
<p>The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six engage in malicious talebearing between monks who are arguing? How can they report to one side what they have heard on the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division, and in this way create new quarrels and make existing quarrels worse?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa112"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you engage in malicious talebearing between monks who are arguing? How can you report to one side what you have heard on the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division, and in this way create new quarrels and make existing quarrels worse? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa113"></a><strong class="rule"><span class="note" hidden>This is translated somewhat freely in accordance with the explanation below and in the commentary. According to <span class="ref">MS.2.144</span> (see below) the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks.” <span class="ref">Sp.4.740.20</span> supports the plural rendering “monks”: “malicious talebearing of monks,” <i lang="pi">bhikkhūnaṃ pesuññe</i>.</span> ‘If a monk engages in malicious talebearing between monks, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
