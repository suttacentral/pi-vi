<h1>Monks’ Confession 4: the training rule on memorizing the Teaching</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.4.1"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.190"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa150"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six were instructing lay followers to memorize the Teaching. Those lay followers became disrespectful, undeferential, and rude towards the monks.</p>
<p><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa151"></a> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six instruct lay followers to memorize the Teaching, those lay followers becoming disrespectful, undeferential, and rude towards the monks?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a> After criticizing those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you instruct lay followers to memorize the Teaching, those lay followers becoming disrespectful, undeferential, and rude towards the monks? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="wt-pa152"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk instructs a person who is not fully ordained to memorize the Teaching, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
