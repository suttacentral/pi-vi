That deity thought, “Perhaps I should just kill this monk?” But then it reconsidered, “It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to just kill this monk. Why don’t I instead inform the Master about this matter?” And it approached the Master and informed him of what had happened.</p>

<p>“Well done, deity! It’s good that you didn’t kill that monk. If you had killed that monk today, you would have made much demerit. The tree over there is empty; take that as your dwelling.”</p>

<p>People complained and criticized those monks, “How can the Sakyan ascetics cut trees and get them cut? They are hurting life with one sense faculty.”</p>
